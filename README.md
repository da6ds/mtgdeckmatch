# Discovering Magic 🎴

> Help people discover Magic: The Gathering through things they already love.

**Live site:** [discoveringmagic.com](https://discoveringmagic.com)

## What is this?

Discovering Magic is a discovery platform that connects people’s existing interests to Magic: The Gathering products. Instead of overwhelming newcomers with 30 years of cards and jargon, we ask one question: **“What are you already into?”**

Then we show them the Fallout deck. The Doctor Who cards. The Furby. The SpongeBob crossover.

The “holy shit, Magic has THAT?!” moment — bottled into a website.

-----

## The Problem

People don’t bounce off Magic because they hate it. They bounce because nothing connected to something they already cared about.

Traditional entry points assume you already care about Magic. We don’t.
